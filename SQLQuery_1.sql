--2. OUTER JOIN: 

--1) LEFT OUTER JOIN: return all the records from the left table and matching records from the right table, if we can not find any
                --matching records, then for that row we will return null. 

--list all customers whether they have made any purchase or not

SELECT c.ContactName, o.OrderDate
FROM Customers c LEFT JOIN Orders o ON c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID


--JOIN with WHERE: 
--customers who never placed any order

SELECT c.ContactName, o.OrderDate
FROM Customers c LEFT JOIN Orders o ON c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID
WHERE o.OrderDate IS NULL


--2) RIGHT OUTER JOIN: return all the records from the right table and matching records from the left table, if we can not find any
                --matching records, then for that row we will return null. 

--list all customers whether they have made any purchase or not

SELECT c.ContactName, o.OrderDate
FROM Orders o RIGHT JOIN Customers c ON c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID


--3) FULL OUTER JOIN: returns all the rows from both left and right table even if we can't find the matching values. 


--Match all customers and suppliers by country.

-- cross join table 1 and table 2 --> 200 rows 

SELECT * FROM Customers

SELECT * FROM Orders

SELECT *
FROM Customers CROSS JOIN Orders 


--* SELF JOIN：a table joins with itself. 

SELECT EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, ReportsTo
